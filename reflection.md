- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Overloading methods:
1. Cafe (default constructor and restock) - Having a default constructor for each subclass seemed helpful and necessary as it initializes attributes of the object. On the other hand, cups run out faster than other coffee materials and since it's easy to restock cups by washing them, restock overloading method seemed right. 
2. House (default constructor and moveOut) - moveOut method is overloaded to empty the arraylist of residents as they move out of the house/campus for summer break.
3. Library(default constructor and Replace) - By replacing all values to true, all books in the library collection are returned and thus ready for use. They could be returned to the library because of year-end inspection or before summer break.
